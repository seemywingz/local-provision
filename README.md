# Run the Setup
The setup script will install both [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works)  
Then Ansible will take care of the rest!

#### Default Setup
  `~/git/redt-local-setup/scripts/setup.sh`

#### Limit Which Tasks to Run  ["cli","apps","dotfiles"]
  `~/git/redt-local-setup/scripts/setup.sh -t "cli,apps"`

#### To Exclude Tasks ["cli","apps","dotfiles"]
  `~/git/redt-local-setup/scripts/setup.sh -e "dotfiles"`
  

# Caveats
#### !! Make sure to watch the teminal durring install, your user password is required !! 

#### ZSH
To change your shell to ZSH
```shell_session 
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```  

#### Java8
If you chose not to use the provided dotfiles, make sure to set the proper `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in your shell's run commands e.g. `~/.bashrc` 
```
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`
```

==> Name
Java Standard Edition Development Kit
==> Artifacts
JDK 8 Update 181.pkg (Pkg)
==> Caveats
This Cask makes minor modifications to the JRE to prevent issues with
packaged applications, as discussed here:

  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=411361

If your Java application still asks for JRE installation, you might need
to reboot or logout/login.

Installing java8 means you have AGREED to the license at
  https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html
```

#### Vim
Vim should auto install `Vim-Plug`   
To install vim plugins with `Vim-Plug`
```
vim -c PlugInstall -c qa
```

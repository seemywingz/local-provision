Java8 Brew Caveats (Mac Only)
###### As of September 20, 2018 latest Java8 version is: 1.8.0_181
```term
==> Caveats
This Cask makes minor modifications to the JRE to prevent issues with
packaged applications, as discussed here:

  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=411361

If your Java application still asks for JRE installation, you might need
to reboot or logout/login.

Installing java8 means you have AGREED to the license at
  https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html
```

#### Vim
Vim should auto install `Vim-Plug`   
To install vim plugins with `Vim-Plug`
```
vim -c PlugInstall -c qa
```

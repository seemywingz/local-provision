Java8 Brew Caveats 
###### As of September 20, 2018 latest Java8 version is: 1.8.0_181
```term
==> Caveats
This Cask makes minor modifications to the JRE to prevent issues with
packaged applications, as discussed here:

  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=411361

If your Java application still asks for JRE installation, you might need
to reboot or logout/login.

Installing java8 means you have AGREED to the license at
  https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html
```

#### Vim
Vim should auto install `Vim-Plug`   
To install vim plugins with `Vim-Plug`
```
vim -c PlugInstall -c qa
```

#### AWS CLI
Before you can run the alias `get-redt-aws-token`  
Docker must be running `CMD+Space` to open Spotlight then search `docker`  
Then build the onelogin SAML image
```bash
cd ~/git/redt-onelogin-aws-saml
docker build . -t onelogin-aws-saml
```
